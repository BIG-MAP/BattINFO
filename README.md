domain-batteryInterface
======================
A battery interface domain ontology based on [EMMO][1]. It is implemented as a formal language.


Status
------
- [x] Proposal
- [ ] accepted, under development
- [ ] official

This domain ontology is work-in-progress (WIP), it will be submitted to the
 EMMC for approval once mature for initial testing.

* Application submitted: TBD
* Application accepted on: TBD


Imported Ontologies
-------------------
This ontology builds on top of EMMO. See the following table for version
compatibilies:

| Imported Ontologies | Version           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| EMMO                | 1.0.0-alpha2      |


Obtaining domain-batteryInterface
--------------------------------
This ontology build on EMMO-1.0.0-alpha2. The correct path to 
the inferred verion 'emmo-inferred' is specified in the catalog file, catalog-v001.xml.

The domain ontology is obtained with:
    git clone git@github.com:BIG-MAP-ontologies/domain-batteryInterface.git

When opening batteryInterface.owl in Protege, the correct version of emmo-inferred will
be downloaded and imported.

In EMMO-python correct import is obatined with 
   get_ontology('batteryInterface.owl).load(url_from_catalog=True)
