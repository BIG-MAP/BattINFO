        <h1>Contributing to BattINFO</h1>
<p>There are two ways you can contribute to BattINFO.</p>
<h3>Suggest minor changes on existing elements</h3>
<p>Create a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">Feature request in a Github Issue</a> to suggest edits to names, defintions, references on existing classes and properties. </p>
<h3>Propose additions/deletion of elements</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  We recommend contacting some of BattINFO contributors in advance to discuss which additions deletions you wish to make.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recoommend using the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow">forking workflow</a> to contribute additions/deletions. Fork this repository, clone the fork on you local PC, create your branch based on the existing <code>dev</code> branch (e.g. <code>dev_john_doe</code>) and work on the editions in you local copy. You can edit ontologes in two main ways. One is programmatically, using for instance <a href="https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMOntoPy">EMMOntoPy</a>. The second and more common is using the interface provided by the Protege software. In case of the latter, <a href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">install Protege</a> and use it to open the ontology file you wish to edit. Before adding elements, ensure Protege is configured to create IRIs in the right format:<br />
* Open Protégé
* Go to File/Open and load the ontology file you wish to modify
* Go to File/Preferences and there go to the New Entities Tab
* Ensure you have configured the preferences with the correct IRI prefixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have made your changes, commit them to your fork and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">create a pull request</a>.</li>
<li>We will merge the request after assessing it.</li>
</ul>
