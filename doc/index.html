<p>The <strong>Batt</strong>ery <strong>IN</strong>ter<strong>F</strong>ace <strong>O</strong>ntology is a digital resource to support interoperability of battery data.   </p>
<p>BattINFO consists of a list of entities representing concepts used in batteries and electrochemistry. Each entity has a unique identifier (IRI) and is annotated with additional information, such as its preferred name ("prefLabel"), alternative names, definition, references, etc. As users link their resources to BattINFO entities, they are effectively describing their resource using a common vocabulary. Resources can be datasets, documents, persons, organizations, equipment, samples... anything linked to the common vocabulary described in BattINFO, becomes part of an ecosystem of Findable resources.</p>
<h2>List of Entities</h2>
<p>Here you can find the entities described in BattINFO, classified in four domains.  </p>
