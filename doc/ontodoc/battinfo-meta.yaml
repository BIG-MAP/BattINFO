abstract: |
  This is a reference documentation for the Battery Interface Ontology
  (BattINFO).

  BattINFO is an ontology of batteries and their interfaces based on
  the top-level European Materials and Modelling Ontology
  (EMMO). BattINFO aims to formalize the current state of knowledge on
  battery interfaces to support the development of computational tools
  and the deployment of interoperable data in the BIG-MAP project and
  beyond. The definitions included in BattINFO are based as far as
  possible on accepted standards defined by the International Union of
  Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) or other preeminent textbooks on
  the subject. BattINFO objects and their relations to each other are
  designed with three goals in mind: (i) to be scientifically rigorous
  and accurate, (ii) to reflect current battery orthodoxy and dominant
  jargon, and (iii) to be flexible to describe a range of battery
  chemistries, not only Li-ion.

  The development of BattINFO is a mammoth undertaking and will continue
  throughout the project. However, it is important to establish an
  initial version to support the activities in other BIG-MAP work
  packages and provide a preliminary platform for collaboration. The
  objective of this deliverable is to establish the initial version of
  BattINFO. This report outlines the conceptual foundation for the
  definitions in the ontology and serves as a guide to help interpret
  the implementation of BattINFO in the ontology web language (OWL).
