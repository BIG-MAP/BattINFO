#+TITLE: Documentation generation for BattInfo
* Requirements
** sphinx
   installation instruction described [[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html][here]]
   #+begin_src
     pip install sphinx
   #+end_src
** install sphinx pydata theme
   https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
   #+begin_src
     pip install pydata-sphinx-theme
   #+end_src
** globabsubs extension
   #+begin_src
     pip install sphinxcontrib-globalsubs
   #+end_src
** autosectionlabel
   - part of default distribution
   - We use ~autosectionlabel_prefix_document = True~ which means that the internal link must be prefixed by the file
     name and a semi-column, see [[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosectionlabel.html][here]].
   
* Workflow for editing

  In the ~Documentation~ directory, run from terminal
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make html
  #+END_SRC

  The command generates all the files for a static website and writes them in ~Documentation/_build/html~

  All the files in this directory must then be copied to the ~BattInfo-doc~ [[https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo-doc][repo]]. From there, make a *force* push. We do
  not keep track of the history of the ouput files (html), but we of course keep track of the documentation source, directly in the
  main repo ~BattInfo~.

  The deployment of the webpage can be followed from the [[https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo-doc/actions][github pages section]]

  The result can be view at
